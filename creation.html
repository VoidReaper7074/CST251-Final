<section id="Races">
<h1>Races</h1>
<p>There's an abundance of species in DND. From humanoids to monsters, there's a vast array of creatures to choose from.
Throughout the years, many new races have been added to the game, but these are these are the core 6 types:</p>
<h2>Humans</h2>
<img src="image/human.png" alt="human"width=300>
<p>In the realm of DND, humans are seen as ambitious, adventurous innovators, conquering lands and forging connections with other races.
To make up for their lack of high fantasy traits, Humans get a +1 to every ability score and a proficiency in an extra language.</p>

<h2>Elves / Half-Elves</h2>
<img src="image/elf.png" alt="elf"width=420>
 <p>Elves are peaceful beings of serene beauty that are passionate about the arts, music, and nature. Half-elves are half human and half
elf, combining the best traits of both races but belonging nowhere.</p>

<h2>Dwarves/Gnomes/Halflings</h2>
<img src="image/dwarf.png" alt="dgh"width=500>
<p>Though they all look similar, these races each come with their own unique perks and abilities:
<br>Dwarves harken from the depths of the mountains, a strong, stocky race with a talent for mining, fighting, and smithing.
<br>Gnomes are a very lively, fast speaking people harkening from the woodlands, drawing enjoyment from every facet of life from inventing to tinkering to cracking jokes.
<br>Halflings are a kind people who tend to reside away from the hustle and bustle of large communities, preferring a good home, a fine drink, and a hearty meal to the spoils of war.</p>

<h2>Orcs/Half-Orcs</h2>
<img src="image/halforc.png" alt="orc"width=450>
<p>Orcs are a huge, brutish warrior race hailing from the god Gruumsh, jutting aws and huge teeth making them an intimidating site.
<br>Half-Orcs are the children of Humans and Orcs, often brought about from the union of 2 groups of people. Like Half-Elfs, their mixed blood
makes them both outcasts from both races and gives them advantages over both.</p>

<h2>Tieflings</h2>
<img src="image/tiefling.png" alt="tiefling"width=300>
<p>Tieflings are humans burdened by an ancient sin, making them devil like creatures with solid eyes, horns, and a thick, lashing tail.
Because of their connection with hell, they are outcasts in every community, often looked at with disdain and distrust.</p>

<h2>Dragonborn</h2>
<img src="image/dragonborn.png" alt="dragonborn"width=300>
<p>Born from the eggs of a dragon, dragonborn are a powerful, respected, yet feared race. Most dragonborns live in clans, living and
breeding </p>

<section id="Class">
<h1>Classes</h1>
<p>You've probably heard of the traditional wizard, but have you heard of sorcerers? Rogues? Barbarians? Here's an overview of the basic
classes you have to choose from:</p>
<h2>Basic Magic Users (Wizards/Sorcerers/Warlocks)</h2>
<img src="image/wizard.jpeg" alt="wizard"width=100><img src="image/warlock.jpeg" alt="warlock"width=100><img src="image/sorcerer.jpeg" alt="sorcerer"width=100>
<p>At first glance, these three classes seem almost identical, but they harken from very different backgrounds.
<br>Wizards obtain their magic through countless hours of study, pulling from the intertwined magic of the universe.
  <br>Sorcerers draw inherent magic from their bloodline, having been granted.
   <br>Warlocks </p>

<h2>Bard</h2>
<img src="image/bard.jpeg" alt="bard"width=100>
<p>Bards are traveling musicians who join groups of adventurers, granting inspiration to their fellow adventurers and weaving tales of their travels.</p>

<h2>Druid</h2>
<img src="image/druid.jpeg" alt="druid"width=100>
<p>Druids draw their power from the deities of the land, casting nature magic and adopting animal forms.</p>

<h2>Cleric/Paladin</h2>
<img src="image/cleric.jpeg" alt="cleric"height=100><img src="img/paladan.jpeg" alt="paladin"width=100>
<p>Both of the classes draw their magic from the gods, but in very different ways:
<br>Clerics draw their divine power through high worship of the gods. They can use theri magic both to heal and to smite.
 <br>Paladins are holy warriors bound to an oath, sworn to a god to uphold truth and justice.</p>

<h2>Rogue</h2>
<img src="image/rogue.jpeg" alt="rogue"width=100>
<p>Rogues are cunning scoundrels who have mastered the art of stealth and deception, traveling the land stealing and swindling.</p>

<h2>Non-Magic Users (Barbarian/Fighter/Monk/Ranger)</h2>
<img src="image/barbarian.jpeg" alt="barbarian"width=100><img src="image/monk.jpeg" alt="monk"width=100><img src="image/fighter.jpeg" alt="fighter"height=100><img src="image/ranger.jpeg" alt="ranger"width=100>
<p>Even though these classes are less magic focused, don't be deceived, they still have magical elements about them.
<br>Barbarians are powerful, primitive fighters capable of going into powerful rages. Though they may not be the brightest,
they are definitely the strongest.
   <br>Fighters are masters of all combat styles, capable of taking on even the toughest of foes.
<br>Monks are martial arts masters who channel the elemental magic of ki into their fighting style. Think Dragon Ball.
  <br>Rangers are deadly hunters that use their skills to hunt down frightening beasts, like poachers but cooler.</p>

<section id="Alignment">
<h1>Alignment/Backstory</h1>
<p>Now that you have your character's physicality and basic traits fleshed out, it's time to give them a personality! While developing their
backstory is up to your preference, each character in DND has an alignment, or where they fall on the morale scale:</p>
<img src="image/allignmentchart.jpg" alt="alignment chart"width=500>
        <p>Think of it as a kind of good guy bad guy rating system but with some in betweens.</p>

<h2>Good</h2>
<p>You're a typical goodie with two shoes. You follow all the rules and always want to do what's right. Peace and love and goodwill!</p>

<h2>Neutral</h2>
<p>You're indifferent. Things could work, or they couldn't. Was that bank just robbed? None of your business.</p>

<h2>Evil</h2>
<p>Dastardly, devilish, deceiving, all words that could be used to describe you. The law, you don't know her!</p>

<h2>Lawful</h2>
<p>The law's the law, it's there for a reason and you live by that montra. Everything in its place, everything in order.</p>

<h2>Chaotic</h2>
<p>You do whatever you want, whatever you want, your way or the highway. What's gonna happen next? Who knows!</p>
