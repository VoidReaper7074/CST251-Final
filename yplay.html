    <h2>Why You Should Try DND </h2>
      <p>DND over the years has become more mainstream due to popular media like TV
      and Youtube.<br> It is more welcoming and less stigmatized than it was decades ago.
     It has even been more accessible <br>thanks to the internet where you can find
     more people to play with, community hubs, and online versions. Youtube has
     made it more accessible to find demos of the game, how-tos, or inspirations
      from other peoples sessions. DND also promotes problem solving skills in
      group settings which can be very useful in real life situations. DND has
      even become more immersive with players getting into cosplay, getting into
       character, and the use of figures as references. However in the end the
       game is not super costly as all you need is just the starter set, some
       dice, paper/pens, and your imagination!

    <h1>Gravity Falls</h1>
      <p>In the Disney Channel Show Gravity Falls, there was an episode where the
    characters played a version of DND but where the characters get stuck inside
     the game. The episode jokes around about how much logical thinking but by
     the end shows the fun in the imagination aspect of the game<br>

    <h1>Community</h1>
    <p>In an episode of the show Community, the study group decides to help a
    depressed guy by playing DND with him to boost his spirits. This message
    shows how DND can bring people together. Fun fact was that this episode was taken
      down because it featured a black face joke that was poorly received.
